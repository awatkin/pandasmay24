# Pandas and Matplotlib May 2024

Sample code to branch for students to test ahead of the exam

The datafile as been simulated to what you could see in the exam, the core code base is similar (as possible) to what you will have in the exam

This is a teaching tool to be able to get your head around Pandas and matplotlib

Make sure to "Fork" the code. 

## Task:

The Theme park has provided the new system requirements. 

These are:
The existing code provided allows users to select different Revenue Streams items and show the sales of that menu item over a period of time.

The solution must also identify trends and patterns over a period of time for:
- The Total sales for each Revenue Streams
- The average sales for AM vs PM for a selected Revenue Stream
- The sales of a selected Revenue stream over a period of days selected by the user
- A comparison of AM sales Vs PM sales combining all revenue streams.

The solution must handle data in a secure way.

They have also provided user requirements for the solution. These are: 
- Program must be easy to use
- Display all information in a meaningful way
- Make use of appropriate textual, numerical and graphical output in a way that would be relevant to the end user. 

Note â€“ the data shows the number of each menu item sold for each of the given days.
