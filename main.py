''' Tasks to be completed
The solution must also identify trends and patterns over a period of time for:

Completed in this code: The Total sales for each Revenue Streams
Completed in this code: The average sales for AM vs PM for a selected Revenue Stream
Completed in this code: The sales of a selected Revenue stream over a period of days selected by the user
A comparison of AM sales Vs PM sales combining all revenue streams.'''
